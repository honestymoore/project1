<h1>Naruto Memory Game!</h1>

<h2>Score: <span id="result"</span></h2>
<!-- line 16 ^ <span has no close, `>` to open tag-->

<div class="grid"></div>

<button type="button" onClick="window.location.reload();">Play Again</button>
<!-- line 21, The attribute name of [ onClick ] must be in lowercase. + this is a bad solution to resetting the game and will do you NO favors in the future, it's just a fancy way of pressing the refresh button. We'll never be able to retain any data or make a full stack let alone single page application this way(tldr: we generally never want to refresh )  -->
<h3>Thank you for playing!</h3>
